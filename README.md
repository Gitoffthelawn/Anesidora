PreHistory:
-----------
The original developer has abandoned the project, therefore this GitHub repository is intended to give a second life to Anesidora project by collaborating with other developers.

This repository was originally imported from here:
[https://code.google.com/p/pandora-extension/](https://code.google.com/p/pandora-extension/)

PostHistory?:
--------------
As mentioned above this project was abandoned by the original authors (of anesidora.tk). It was then exported to github from code.google.com (without the GPLv2 Lisence) I have forked that repo to generate a firefox version of the addon. I have also included the orignial GPLv2 Lisence from the original project
